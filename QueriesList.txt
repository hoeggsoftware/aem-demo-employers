##TO-DO##
Set up meeting with Ruk to go over some of the content and how it is set up to get a better understand so I can know what to provide him with and know where to look for things as necessary.

List of queries to make:

Nav-items
Job-seeker and Employer sub-items
Footer-items -> NEEDS MORE CONTENT
Job-seeker and Employer benefits
Office Locations
Languages???
Job-seeker and Employer Next Steps
News -> fake articles -> NEED MORE INFO FOR THE NEWS BOX!!!
same find quickly items from the footer. But, only the find quickly so should be able to use the footer-items.

## create section under footer to shows the logo and contact info.
## get Ruk to update nav and footer items with proper linkage which is the page with /path no need to do full URL. So it should be path and not url in the persisted query. CREATE LIST


nav-items:

{
  navigationElementList {
    items {
      title
      image {
       	... on DocumentRef {
          size
          format
          _publishUrl          
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
